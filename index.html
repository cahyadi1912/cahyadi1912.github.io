          <h3>Child mortality in year 2000</h3>
          <p id="page1story">
            This scatterplot shows the child mortality in different
            countries in year 2000, plotted against their respective GDP per Capita.
            It can be seen quite clearly that there is a relationship between
            a country's GDP per capita and its child mortality. Countries with higher
            GDP per capita tend to have lower child mortality; while the poorer countries
            with lower GDP per capita tend to have higher child mortality. The Sub SubSaharan
            African countries have the highest child mortality.

          <h3>Progress of child mortality and GDP per capita</h3>
          <p>
            Since year 2000 most countries have been progressing with declining
            number of child mortality and increasing GDP per capita. Among high GDP per capita countries
            USA has higher child mortality due to its large population.

          <h3>Cause of child mortality</h3>
          <p>
            As of year 2017 prematurity, accute lower respiratory infection, and
            birth asphyxia and birth trauma are the top 3 cause of child mortality.
            Certain diseases that were previously prominent 2 decades ago, such
            as diarrhoea diseases and malaria have dropped their ranks.
            The total mortality have dropped by 45.8% over the past 2 decades,
            bringing the child mortality level from 9 to 5 millions.
