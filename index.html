          <h3>Child mortality in year 2000</h3>
          <p id="page1story">
            This scatterplot shows an overview of child mortality in various countries around the world
            in year 2000, plotted against their respective GDP per capita.
            From this scatterplot it can be seen that there is a relationship between
            a country's GDP per capita and its child mortality. Countries with higher
            GDP per capita tend to have lower child mortality while the poorer countries
            with lower GDP per capita tend to have higher child mortality.
            From this scatter plot we can also see that Sub-Saharan African countries have the highest child mortality.
            European &  Central Asian countries are located at the other end with higher GDP per capita and lower child mortality.

          <h3>Progress of child mortality and GDP per capita</h3>
          <p>
            In the past 2 decades most countries have been progressing with declining  number of child mortality
            and increasing GDP per capita. Since the child mortality numbers displayed here are the total mortality figures
            in each country, and not the mortality rate per certain number of birth or population, some countries with higher population
            appear in the chart as having high child mortality. This is the case for USA. Among the wealthy countries,
            USA has relatively high child mortality due its large population.

          <h3>Causes of child mortality</h3>
          <p>
            As of year 2017 prematurity, accute lower respiratory infection, and
            birth asphyxia and birth trauma are the top 3 cause of child mortality.
            Certain diseases that were previously prominent 2 decades ago, such
            as diarrhoea diseases and malaria have dropped their ranks.
            The total mortality have dropped by 45.8% over the past 2 decades,
            bringing the child mortality level from 9 to 5 millions.
